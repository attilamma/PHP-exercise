# PHP-exercise

This is a PHP exercise with a user login and registration with database connection.

### Prerequisites

I ran this project on localhost. You can download the [XAMPP Control Panel](https://www.apachefriends.org/de/download.html) for free.


## Getting Started

1. Put the project files in your installation folder. C:\xampp\htdocs\exampleproject
2. Then run the Modules "Apache" and "MySQL".
3. Open your browser and go to localhost:80 or localhost:81 or any other port, depending on the portnumber you use.
You should see the login page now.

## Inserting Data into the Database

Go to http://localhost:81/phpmyadmin .
On the left hand side, you can create a new database.
